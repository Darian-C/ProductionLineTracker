# Production Line 

This very special java program was created by Darian Colon from Aug 19,2019 to Dec 09, 2019. It is designed to allow the user 
to add certain product to a database to be recorded for later use. This program was a project for a college junior level
course at Florida Gulf Coast University. The purpose of this project is to help students develop a proficiency by 
creating a program that is function while using java topics taught during the course.<br />
