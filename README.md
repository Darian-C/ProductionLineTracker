# Production Line 

This very special java program was created by Darian Colon from Aug 19,2019 to Dec 09, 2019. It is designed to allow the user 
to add certain product to a database to be recorded for later use. This program was a project for a college junior level
course at Florida Gulf Coast University. The purpose of this project is to help students develop a proficiency by 
creating a program that is function while using java topics taught during the course.<br />


## Demonstration

Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/
Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action.

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)
